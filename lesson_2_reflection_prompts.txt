An empty repository was created. I need a repository to save old version of all the files.
It helps to give a more procise control of our commits.
Use git diff and git diff --staged to check if the logical change was added to the staging area or committed to the repository.
When I want to create a new version of the file and I don't want to change the old version, branch is helpful.
Diagram can make the structure more clearly.
Marging two branches help us combine different works from different people, it's high efficient.
Marging automatically will definitely help.
